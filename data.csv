It was further developed into a television series, several stage plays, comics, a video game, and a 2005 feature film. Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame.[2]",//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Douglas_adams_portrait_cropped.jpg/220px-Douglas_adams_portrait_cropped.jpg
